            <p> Growing up in the Chicagoland area had it's ups and downs.</p>
            <p> Living in the midwest usually meant spending ample time on the internet.</p>
            <p> This led to being exposed to the dot com era.</p>
            <p> Even though I was on the internet a lot, I never really took much time to learn much else.</p>
            <p> Until the day I decided to install a linux distro when I was 15. </p>

            <h1> I've been interested in programming and software development since. </h1>
            <p> I turn 30 this year. That means 15 years of being "interested"</p>
            <h3> Enough is enough!</h3>
            <p> My cousin recommended Lambda School after I expressed interest in javascript.</p>
            <p> I began teaching myself but quickly found that I would lose interest and move on to other hobbies</p>

            <h2> I'm finally going all in and I couldn't be more excited to begin this journey.</h2>
            <p> Being mentored by two cousins that work in software development and computer science, I've found that
                it's a
                large hurdle.</p>
            <p> It is becoming easier to grasp, and the fundamentals are [almost] making sense. </p>
            <p> I've been told time after time: it takes time.</p>
